# 💧 DropLess

An app where you can earn crypto rewards for consuming less water than the average household.

Powered by VeChain and VeBetterDAO.

## ⚙️ How it works

1. **Login** with your VeWorld wallet or social account.
2. **Setup your household** - add size, country, and current water meter reading.
3. **Submit a photo** of your water meter after some time.
4. **AI processes** your photo using Google Gemini to extract the reading.
5. **Get rewarded** - earn 1 $B3TR token for every cubic meter saved below average.
6. **Track progress** on your household page with consumption history and rewards.

The entire process is automated through VeChain smart contracts integrated with VeBetterDAO.
